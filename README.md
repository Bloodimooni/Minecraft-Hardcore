# How to use it?

1. To start, you will need to install python3 
https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. You need to download the minecraft server files and agree to the Eula.

# Once you are setup

Simply put the python file in the same directory as your server and run it in a terminal using:
python hardcore.py on windows 
or
python3 hardocore.py on linux.

If you get an error on Linux, try running the following command: ```sudo chmod +x run.sh```

### OR

Download the latest release bundle and run the installer
Then simply go into the server folder and run the hardcore file!



If you want to shutdown the Server, just press CTRL + C and the server will shut down and save everything.

Enjoy!
